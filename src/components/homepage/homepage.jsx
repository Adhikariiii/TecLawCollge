                The standard of legal education in our country is rudimentary.
                For the development of educational quality, I strongly believe
                on materializing thoughts with the intense determination of
                identifying social facts to bring them into practical
                reality.With the motive of producing legal professionals within
                the country in international standard, NaLC has not compromised
                in terms of physical infrastructure or human resources. Every
                year the flow of mass students to abroad to achieve the degree
                of law is multiplying. Therefore, our institution is dedicated
                in maintaining the international standard of legal education
                incorporating full phase digital facilities including online
                assignment, on line library services, power point based class
                discussion and periodic update of the legal development in the
                country.... I believe will be the best option for them to pursue
                standard legal education in the country. The teaching faculty
                members including professors, associate professors, assisting
                professors and adjunct faculty members as well administrative
                members are self-motivated, cultured and professional in their
                respective jobs.{" "}
